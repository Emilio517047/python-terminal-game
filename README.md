# python-terminal-game

## A Pokemon themed game, written in python to be played in the terminal.

### Description

This is a small project taken from Codecademy's computer science course. 
It is written in Python and the aim was to create a game, that someone could play in the terminal.
With this game, the aim is to catch a pokemon. 
The goal was to let a user decide if they wanted to weaken the pokemon through battle or throw a pokeball to catch it.
A random number would be generated to decide how much damage they would do through battling and the chances of catching a pokemon.
I'm still running through some issues with the code however, so I will try to add improvements and solutions in the future.

### Details

Written in Python 3.
Written in Virtual Studio Code.

### Requirements

Python 3 installed.
A terminal/ command line.
